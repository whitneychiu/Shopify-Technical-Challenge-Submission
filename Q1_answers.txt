a. 
The reason why the naive AOV of 3145.13 is so high is because it is directly calculated by taking the total revenue (sum of order_amount) 
divided by the total orders (5000). It does not take into account the number of shoes (pairs) purchased in each transaction.

By creating a box plot and looking at the maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation, I realized that the standard deviation of "order_amount" 
is extremely large, meaning that there is likely outliers that are driving the mean up. 

A few questionable observations include: 17 transactions with order_amount of 70400 that includes a total of 2000 items, 16 transactions with order_amount 
of 51450 that includes a total of 2 items, 19 transactions with order_amount of 51450 that includes a total of 1 item. The aforementioned extreme points 
with extremely high "order_amount" are driving up the overall AOV, making the AOV not representative of the entire dataset.

Due to the extreme outliers, the mean is skewed upwards. I would use a median as an evaluation metric instead of a mean. That being said, I would took at 
the "median order value" instead of the "average order value".

b.
Instead of using the "average order value", I would take the "median order value" as an evaluation metric to protect the metric from being influenced by outliers.

c.
The median "median order value" of the entire data set is 284, which is a much more reasonable value considering single-transaction purchases of sneakers.
