a. The reason why the naive AOV of 3145.13 is so high is because it is directly calculated by taking the total revenue (sum of order_amount) divided by the total orders (5000). It does not take into account the number of shoes (pairs) purchased in each transaction.

By creating a box plot and looking at the maximum, minimum, mean and standard deviation, I realized that the standard deviation of "order_amount" os extremely large, meaning that there is likely outliers that are driving the mean up. 

A few questionable observations include: 17 transactions with order_amount of 70400 that includes a total of 2000 items, 16 transactions with order_amount of 51450 that includes a total of 2 items, 19 transactions with order_amount of 51450 that includes a total of 1 item. The aforementioned extreme points with extremely high "order_amount" are driving up the overall AOV, making the AOV not representative of the entire dataset.

Due to the extreme outliers, the mean is skewed upwards. To provide a more representative evaluation metric, I would stratify the dataset into two groups, namely dataset with large orders and dataset with small orders 

I would use a median instead of a mean. The median AOV of the entire data set is 284, which is much more reasonable


b.
I would use a median instead of a mean to protect the metric from being influenced by outliers.

c.
The median AOV of the entire data set is 284, which is a much more reasonable value considering that we are talking about single-transaction purchases of sneakers.
